# Important: Existing Tasks Won't Have Details

## Why Existing Tasks Don't Show Details

If you created tasks BEFORE this update, they won't have the `details` field because:

1. The old AI service didn't generate details
2. The old fallback plan didn't include details
3. Tasks are stored in DynamoDB with the data they were created with

## What This Means

**Existing tasks**: No details (created with old code)
**New tasks**: Will have 2-4 bullet points per subtask (created with new code)

## How to Test Details Feature

To see the details feature working:

1. **Deploy the backend first** (see DEPLOY_BACKEND_MANUALLY.md)
2. **Create a NEW task** after deployment
3. Open the new task details page
4. You should see "Show Details (3)" or similar for each subtask
5. Click to expand and see the bullet points

## Example of What You'll See

```
✅ Research and planning for Learn React
   ▼ Hide Details (3)
   • Gather requirements and objectives
   • Research best practices and approaches
   • Create initial project outline
   
   Track Progress: [=========>        ] 45%
```

## Your Existing Tasks

Your existing tasks will still work perfectly:
- ✅ Progress slider will work (after backend deployment)
- ✅ Checkboxes will work
- ✅ All functionality intact
- ❌ Just won't have the details section (because they were created before this feature)

## Solution for Existing Tasks

If you want details for existing tasks, you have two options:

1. **Keep them as-is** - They still work fine, just without details
2. **Recreate them** - Delete and create new tasks to get details

I recommend option 1 (keep them) unless you really want the details feature for those specific tasks.

## The Details Feature

The details feature adds helpful context to each subtask:
- Breaks down what needs to be done
- Provides step-by-step guidance
- Makes subtasks clearer and more actionable
- Generated by AI based on the task name

This is especially helpful for complex tasks where subtasks need more explanation.
