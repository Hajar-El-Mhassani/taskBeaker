# Quick Deploy Commands

## Copy and paste these commands in WSL/Ubuntu:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Bruger/Documents/TaskBreaker/backend
sam build
sam deploy --force-upload
```

That's it! Wait 3-4 minutes for deployment to complete.

## What This Fixes

✅ Progress slider persistence
✅ Profile update errors
✅ Subtask details (for new tasks)

## After Deployment

Test by:
1. Moving a progress slider and refreshing
2. Updating your profile name
3. Creating a new task and checking for details

All issues should be resolved! 🎉
